# Palindrome checker task

A string is said to be a palindrome if it is the same if we start reading it from left to right or right to left.

## About

There is a individual class for String (StringPalindrome.java) and Array of Strings(ArrayPalindrome.java)

### Input
String
Array of Strings

### Controller
Reverse the string via loop 
check for ignore charracters
write new string excluding ignore characters

### Output
stringResult
string - initial string formatted
checkString - literal string that is concated - used for temp calculation

## Testing
(ArrayPalindrome.java) not yet tested

Began looking at the hashcode and equals contract

Tested Strings and Array of Strings as a input and confirmed the results are equal

## Task 

Create a method that takes a String as parameter and returns whether that String is a palindrome.

Consider:
- character case
- full sentences with spaces and special characters
- "invalid" inputs

- Test and document your project
- Upload to GitHub
- Send your trainer an email with a link to your repository


Extra considerations:
- Taking a String array as input and returning all the palindromes in that array
