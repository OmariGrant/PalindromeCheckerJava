# Palindrome checker task

A string is said to be a palindrome if it is the same if we start reading it from left to right or right to left.

## Task 

Create a method that takes a String as parameter and returns whether that String is a palindrome.

Consider:
- character case
- full sentences with spaces and special characters
- "invalid" inputs

- Test and document your project
- Upload to GitHub
- Send your trainer an email with a link to your repository


Extra considerations:
- Taking a String array as input and returning all the palindromes in that array
